### Date & Time:
Thursdays 10:00 am - 11:30 am  


### Location:
Norlin Library Room E206 (CRDDS)


### Description:  
This workshop series will provide a brief overview of Python programming and some research-useful Python packages. This course will not cover â€œhow to program;" attendees are expected to have introductory-level experience in at least one other programming language. 

### Prerequisites
The lessons in this course are interactive in nature.  In order to particpate, you will need a laptop with a working Python installation and the following Python packages installed:  NumPy, Matplotlib, Mayavi, H5Py, F2Py, and Cython.

The most straightforward way to install this software is via the Conda environment manager.  Please refer to the software_installation.pdf file in this repository for instructions on installing Conda, Python, and the necesssary packages.  If you need one-on-one help with the installation process, please drop by during the optional, September 20th session.  Alternatively, feel free to send me an email, and we can set up a time to meet in my office (ARC 677; east campus).
